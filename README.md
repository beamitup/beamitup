- 👋 Hi, I’m @beamitup
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Neuromorphic Computing, and Symbolic Logic Applications for Neural Networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above!!
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to send me notes here!
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wrote and published a book on logical suggestions for robots in 2012! Look for books on Amazon, at their warehouses or through Barnes & Noble.
- https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/AreaAndVolumeOfNDimensionalSpheres/ is a good website for determining which higher dimensional formula you need to calculate which higher dimensional volume or hypervolume, for spheres. Wormhole / Space-Time Tunnel Mathematics.
- Excite Entangled Bodies To Make Wormholes - Physics + A Song - Available On Streaming Music Services Worldwide.

- Taylor Swift is very good looking in the music video for the song 'Bad Blood', and that music video has Selena Gomez in it as well. If Nicki Minaj was a star in that video as well, it would be nearly perfect! Look inside buildings, not merely to see if their exteriors are similar, in terms of knowing, if you know a location. International Business Machines and IBM should all know DeepBlue.
- Tumblr.com is an interesting resource for content + information. Reddit sometimes has interesting content as do the subdomains of Fandom.com especially Memory Alpha. Google and Microsoft and Bing and CoPilot and Gemini and Llama and Meta and Facebook and OpenAI and ChatGPU are all interesting search terms. YouTube.com has very interesting music, especially related to Matisyahu, Nicki Minaj, 7!!, Taylor Swift, Lana del Rey, Selena Gomez, Camilla Cabello, and many many others. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan must have been quite a thing to see on those ginormous 17 inch black and white television screens in I guestimate, without googling the exact year myself, 1964, which would be 60 years prior to the time of this edit (push / commit) 2024.
- One Day, violent crime will be stopped by military robots (assuredly, because police robots might not have all the military intelligence they need to analyze sufficient data) and they'll do it without Time Travel.
